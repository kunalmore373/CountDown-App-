2. JavaScript calculates the time difference between the two.
3. The remaining time is updated every second.
4. The progress bar fills up as time passes.
5. When the end time is reached:

   * Progress bar becomes 100%
   * Countdown stops
   * "EXPIRED!!" message is displayed
   * Alert is triggered
